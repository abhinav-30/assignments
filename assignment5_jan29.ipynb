    "Memory management in Python is handled automatically by the language itself through a system called the Python Memory Manager. The memory manager is responsible for allocating and freeing memory for Python objects.\n",
    "Python uses a garbage collector to automatically detect and remove objects that are no longer being used. The garbage collector periodically scans the memory to identify and delete any objects that are no longer referenced by the program. This is called reference counting.\n",
    "In addition to reference counting, Python also uses a technique called memory pooling to manage memory more efficiently. This involves reusing memory that has been previously allocated and freed, instead of requesting new memory from the operating system. This can help to reduce memory fragmentation and improve performance."
